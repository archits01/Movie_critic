## Advanced Filtering

The GET `/api/movies` endpoint supports advanced filtering with query parameters:

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | Search by movie title (case-insensitive) | `?name=dark` |
| `year` | Filter by release year | `?year=2008` |
| `sort` | Sort alphabetically (`asc` or `desc`) | `?sort=asc` |
| `limit` | Limit number of results | `?limit=3` |

### Advanced Filtering Examples

```bash
# Search for movies with "dark" in title
GET /api/movies?name=dark

# Get movies from 2008
GET /api/movies?year=2008

# Get top 3 movies sorted alphabetically
GET /api/movies?limit=3&sort=asc

# Combined filters: movies with 'a' in name, from 2023, top 3, sorted A-Z
GET /api/movies?name=a&year=2023&limit=3&sort=asc

# Get all movies sorted Z-A
GET /api/movies?sort=desc
```

## Validation Rules

- All fields (title, category, releaseYear, rating) are required
- Rating must be between 0 and 10
- Release year must be 1900 or later
- Duplicate titles are not allowed (case-insensitive)

## Error Handling

- `400` - Bad Request (validation errors)
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Internal Server Error
